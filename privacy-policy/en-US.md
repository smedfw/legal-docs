# SME Virtual Network Privacy Policy

June 25, 2018

Your privacy is an important factor that the SME Virtual Network (that's us)
considers in the development of our services. We are committed to being
transparent and open. This Privacy Policy explains generally how we receive
information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.

## What do we mean by "personal information?"

For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like your
name or email address.

Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we
will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal
information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.

## How do we learn information about you?

We learn information about you when:

* you give it to us directly;
* we collect it automatically through our services; or
* when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services).

## What do we do with your information once we have it?

When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given
us permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve
our services for you.

## When do we share your information with others?

* When we have asked and received your permission to share it.
* For processing or providing SME membership information to you.
* When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.
* When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, the SME Virtual Network or the public.

## How do we store and protect your personal information?

We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it and we
make reasonable efforts to do so. We implement physical, business and technical
security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll
notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it,
so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't
need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it
longer.

## What else should you know?

We use service providers whose computers may also be in various countries. This
means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another
country, and that country may have a different level of data protection
regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of
transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in,
we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in
this privacy policy.

If you are under 13, we don't want your personal information, and you must not
provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your child who is under
13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at hello@smevirtual.com
to have your child's information removed.

## What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?

We may need to change this policy and our notices.  The updates will be posted
online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through
the SME Virtual Network's usual channels for such announcements such as blog
posts, forums or any suitable media of our choosing. Your continued use of SME
Virtual Network services after the effective date of such changes constitutes
your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will
post an effective date at the top of the page.
