## Terms of Use

### 1\. Introduction

Please read the terms of this entire document (“Terms”) carefully because it
explains your rights and responsibilities when you visit any of SME Virtual Network's
websites (“Websites”), or related feeds, social media, newsletters, source code
repositories, and emails (together with Websites, these are collectively referred
to as “Communications”). By accessing or signing up to receive Communications,
you agree to be bound by these Terms.

Our Websites include multiple domains such as smevirtual.com and smevirtual.org.
Some of our Websites connect you with links, apps or add-ons that are provided
by other parties and are subject to separate Terms.

### 2\. Account Registration

Some Websites require you to register for an account in order to access
additional features of a Website or another SME Virtual Network service.
If applicable, additional terms will be presented to you. You are responsible
for all activities under your account.

Some Websites allow you to create a username during registration. Your use of a
username must comply with our
[Acceptable Use Policy](https://github.com/smevirtual/legal-docs/blob/master/acceptable-use-policy/en-US.md). 

### 3\. Content Licensing

Our Communications include content such as articles, images, photographs,
comments, software code, audio and video clips, and other materials (collectively,
“Content”).  Content is authored by the SME Virtual Network, contributors to SME
Virtual Network projects, and other sources. 

Content authored by the SME Virtual Network is generally made available for
public sharing and reuse through open licenses such as Creative Commons
(for expressive material) or other open-source licenses (for software code).
In most cases we ask SME Virtual Network contributors to release Content under
open licenses. 

Some Content in our Communications is acquired from sources that prohibit further
use of their Content without advance permission.  Where possible, the Content or
Website footer will display a notice with the applicable license. You agree to
abide by such notices. Note the following specifics:

* Some Content expressly indicates that the author does not intend for an open license to apply. You should contact the author or author’s agent for permission to use such Content. Questions on SME Virtual Network authored content can be sent to: hello@smevirtual.com.
* Some Content contains trademarks, trade dress, logos and brand assets of the SME Virtual Network and other parties (“Trademarks”).  Except for a few limited circumstances, Trademarks cannot be used without advance written permission of the owner of the Trademark.
* Software used by our Websites is licensed under Apache 2.0, the MIT License or similarly permissive open source licenses. For more information on the specific license, please see the applicable source code or GitHub repository. 

### 4\. Content Submissions

You may contribute Content when interacting with our Communications, including
but not limited to commenting on an article, blogging, contributing code, or
contributing graphics or written material (each a “Submission”). Unless your
Submission is made under a separate agreement with the SME Virtual Network, in
which case that agreement will govern, then
   
For Submissions to SME Virtual Network's open source projects:

* You agree to license your Submission under the terms of the corresponding license of the particular open source project to which you are contributing. For more information on the specific license, please see the applicable source code or GitHub repository.

For all other Submissions, you agree to the following in connection with each:

* You represent and warrant that your Submission will comply with these Terms, the SME Virtual Network [Conditions of Use](https://github.com/smevirtual/legal-docs/blob/master/acceptable-use-policy/en-US.md), and any additional terms that may govern your Submission.
* You hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable (to those we work with) license to use your Submission in connection with the Communications and online and offline promotion of the SME Virtual Network's mission and services.
* You acknowledge that your Submissions may be accessible by other registered users of the applicable service or the public.
* If your Submission contains expressive material or software code, you agree to license it in a manner that is compatible with the particular Website you are making a Submission to. 
* You represent and warrant that you have the rights necessary to grant the rights granted herein, and further, that the uses contemplated under these Terms will not infringe the proprietary or intellectual property rights of any third party.
* You understand and agree that the SME Virtual Network reserves the right, at its discretion, to review, modify, or remove any Submission that it deems is objectionable or in violation of these Terms.

### 5\. Privacy Policy & Cookies

The [SME Virtual Network Websites, Communications & Cookies Privacy Notice](https://github.com/smevirtual/legal-docs/blob/master/websites-privacy-notice/en-US.md)
describes how we handle information that we receive from you in connection with
our Communications. The Privacy Notice explains, for example, that we place
certain cookies on our Websites and how you can opt-out.

### 6\. Communications and Events

If you subscribe to receive our newsletters or register for an account in
connection with any of our Websites, you may receive transactional emails from
us in connection with your account (for example, legal, privacy, membership
information and security updates).

Some of our Websites provide tools that enable users to arrange physical or
virtual events for anyone to attend. Please exercise caution and good judgment
when attending events.

### 7\. Term; Termination

These Terms will continue to apply until ended by either you or the SME Virtual
Network. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by discontinuing
your use of our Communications and, if applicable, deleting your account.

We may suspend or terminate your access to our Communications at any time for
any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have
violated these Terms, our Acceptable Use Policy, or other relevant policy;
(ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision
of the Communications to you is no longer commercially viable.

In all such cases, these Terms shall terminate, except that the following
sections shall continue to apply: Indemnification, Disclaimer; Limitation of
Liability, Miscellaneous.

### 8\. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the SME Virtual Network, its
volunteers, contributors, licensors, and partners; and the respective directors,
officers, employees and agents of the foregoing ("Indemnified Parties") from and
against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees,
arising out of or related to your use of our Communications (including, but not
limited to, from your Submissions or from your violation of any these Terms).

### 9\. Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability

THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, THE SME VIRTUAL NETWORK AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL
WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES
THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGING. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO USING THE
COMMUNICATIONS FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
COMMUNICATIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RISK THAT YOUR HARDWARE,
SOFTWARE, OR CONTENT IS DELETED OR CORRUPTED, THAT SOMEONE ELSE GAINS UNAUTHORIZED
ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION, OR THAT ANOTHER USER MISUSES OR MISAPPROPRIATES YOUR
SUBMISSION. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, SME VIRTUAL NETWORK AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WILL
NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE COMMUNICATIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT AND
INDIRECT DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA,
AND COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH
SUCH CLAIM IS BASED. THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF THE SME VIRTUAL NETWORK AND THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $500 (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS).
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.

### 10\. Modifications to these Terms  

We may update these Terms from time to time to address a new feature of the
Communications or to clarify a provision. The updated Terms will be posted online.
If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through our usual
channels for such announcements such as blog posts, banners, emails, or forums.
Your continued use of our Communications after the effective date of such
changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more
convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of this page.

### 11\. Miscellaneous  

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the SME Virtual Network
concerning our Communications and supersede any prior versions of these Terms.
